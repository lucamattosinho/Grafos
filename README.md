Simple graph algorithms for college projects.

MaxFlow.py implements and tests the Edmonds–Karp algorithm, which is an implementation of the Ford–Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network in O ( | V | | E | ² ) time.

RandomTreesGeneration.py implements and tests two algorithms. 
First one is RandomTreeRandomWalk, that generates a completely random tree with a set number of vertices and a random value between 0 and 1 that represents the edge value between two vertices. 
Second one is RandomTreeKruskal, which uses Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm to generate a random tree.
